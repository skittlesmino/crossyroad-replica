A replica of the game called Crossy Road made with Unity engine.
This is my first ever game attempt in which I tried to copy the original game, to get into game development.
Note that some of the code is inspired from guides and tutorials on youtube, but I tried to stay original with the solutions, as long as I could.
The models are also my first attempts at modelling, and they were created with Blender. The small car was copied from a youtuber called Imphenzia, the others are made by me.
I included the built version of the game, also a unity package file, and the original Asset files also.
The code is obviously not the most efficient and very well organized but I tried my best. I did not include any documentation in the csharp scripts.
I am open to any suggestions and opinions.
